                    Hi, I'm Ryan Cai, a full-stack software engineer with a degree in Software Engineering from the University of New South Wales. With over three years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building scalable, responsive web applications using modern technologies such as React, Next.js, and HTML/CSS on the frontend, and Golang with MySQL on the backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                Throughout my career, I've led projects that optimized system performance and streamlined business operations by implementing robust solutions and integrating efficient CI/CD pipelines. I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and thrive in Agile environments where collaboration and continuous learning drive innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant, user-centric solutions and am always eager to explore new tools and technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web. I'm currently looking for new opportunities where I can contribute my skills, grow as an engineer, and make a meaningful impact.
                </p>
